## Introduction

The Laravel Orchid community offers a remarkable experience where you can collaborate with individuals from around the world, shaping unique computing experiences together. To ensure a comfortable and inclusive environment for all participants, it is essential to adhere to the following rules in all community-related spaces such as GitHub, community resources, face-to-face conversations, and more.

## Mutual Respect

Being part of the Laravel Orchid community means being part of something big. However, it also comes with the responsibility to respect everyone involved. By following these guidelines, you contribute to an environment where each participant feels valued and included. Whether you are posting online or engaging in a chat, always keep the following rules in mind.

## Content Guidelines

As the Laravel Orchid community encompasses users of different backgrounds, ages, and maturity levels, it is crucial to consider the content you create and the comments you leave. To maintain a positive atmosphere, please refrain from sharing adult materials, using offensive language, discussing political or religious subjects, or sharing any other inappropriate content. Ultimately, the Laravel Orchid moderators have the final say in determining whether content is appropriate. When in doubt, imagine that your audience includes children and elderly individuals from around the world. It is always best to err on the side of caution and abstain from posting potentially inappropriate content.

Furthermore, screenshots shared within Laravel Orchid communities should not include themes that imitate other web systems, photos or images targeting specific individuals, or any other content that violates our Code of Conduct.

## Rumors and Speculation

While the Laravel Orchid community thrives on excitement and constant progress, we kindly request that you refrain from spreading rumors or speculation. Discussing future plans is acceptable, as long as it is clear that they are not confirmed facts but rather speculative ideas. Spreading inaccurate information can be harmful to the community, especially when it is done in a negative manner.

## Meaningful Discussions

Laravel Orchid is the result of the collaborative efforts of many individuals who contribute their free time for a common goal â€“ creating something extraordinary. It is vital to always remember this and actively engage in beneficial and substantial discussions. Whether attending meetings, commenting on blog posts, or participating in discussions over mail or Telegram, please ensure your contributions are directly related to the topics under discussion. Avoid asking unnecessary questions or engaging in conversations that divert attention from the development process. By doing so, you will help maintain the clarity and effectiveness of conversations while respecting the time and effort put into the discussion by everyone involved.

As an online community, it is our responsibility to minimize the negative aspects that are often associated with virtual networks. Refrain from engaging in trolling, which includes engaging in verbal skirmishes or making comments with the sole purpose of ridiculing others. Additionally, avoid spamming the community with unrelated links or repeatedly posting the same web page. If you come across a user who is engaging in trolling or spamming, simply ignore them and report their behavior to the moderators.

## Conflict Resolution

If you encounter someone, whether a newcomer or an established member, who is behaving rudely, we encourage you to politely address the issue. It is crucial to address problems promptly to prevent them from escalating into bigger conflicts. Every community member plays a vital role in ensuring smooth communication in our unique (and sometimes quirky) work environment.

## Departing with Grace

Priorities, interests, and hobbies change over time. If you are involved in a Laravel Orchid-related project and find yourself needing to step away, please make the transition as seamless as possible for the community. When we collaborate, the fruits of our labor and ideas belong to the Laravel Orchid community as a whole. Inform other team members of your intentions to retire and, if feasible, arrange for someone to continue your work. At the very least, ensure that your work can continue even after you leave.

## Consequences

Failure to comply with the aforementioned rules of behavior or engaging in behavior that disrupts the community may result in the following consequences:

- Content you have published may be changed or deleted.
- Your account on third-party websites may be disabled or blocked.
- Any other necessary measures may be taken to prevent your further interaction with the community.
