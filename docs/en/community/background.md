## Orchid Wasn't Built Overnight

While working at an agency, we realized that modern frameworks are great for development but lack a convenient web
interface for administration. At the time, some solutions existed, but they were either too complex or cumbersome to
use.

In 2016, while developing a large travel portal, we saw an opportunity to simultaneously create a Laravel-based CMS that
would solve these issues and streamline routine tasks. This led to the first version of the package.

Over time, we realized the product was too specialized. In 2017, we removed everything directly related to CMS
functionality, leaving only the tools for building UI interfaces. This transformation allowed Orchid to be used for
developing any kind of administrative application.

Our inspiration came from Microsoft's approach with Visual Studio LightSwitch, where developers define screens, and the
system automatically generates interfaces. This concept shaped Orchid into what it is today.

## The Right Tool for the Right Job

Orchid is designed for building intranet applications (Admin panels, dashboards, LOB applications, etc.).
It is not intended for developing websites or marketing landing pages but can be used as an administration panel for
them.

## Simplicity and Maintainability

Orchid follows a declarative approach to UI design, making it easy to create interfaces without deep knowledge of HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, or complex build tools.  
We want you to write most of your code in PHP, without getting distracted by unnecessary tools or dealing with breaking
library updates.  
This way, you can focus on creating unique value for your users.

Achieving this goal requires continuous improvement. We adhere to best practices from established frameworks to keep
implementation precise, avoiding unnecessary complexity and code bloat.  
That’s why we don’t add new features unless they are truly essential for the majority of users.
