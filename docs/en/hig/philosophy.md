## Concision

Orchid prioritizes simplicity and user experience, ensuring key functions of the application are easily accessible through consistent and intuitive navigation and workspace. The platform offers a consistent interaction language and visual design, providing a seamless experience for tasks such as fulfilling sales orders, reviewing KPIs, or managing vacation requests.

Designed for adaptability, Orchid can be used effectively on both mobile devices and desktop computers. The app provides complete information without any clipping, ensuring a seamless transition between devices and a consistent user experience.

## Avoid Feature Bloat

Orchid places a strong emphasis on simplicity by being selective about adding new features. It is essential to understand that each new feature brings with it consequences, such as:

* Slower app performance and increased resource consumption
* A cluttered interface that becomes more difficult to use
* Diversion of time and effort away from refining existing features
* Increased code complexity, leading to a higher risk of bugs
* Additional translation and localization work


By focusing on a streamlined, intuitive user experience, Orchid helps you work more efficiently and effectively.

Orchid is mindful of avoiding feature bloat and excessive customizations, as they can lead to several drawbacks such as slower performance, cluttered interface, increased implementation time, increased potential for bugs, and additional documentation and translation work.

Therefore, before introducing any new customization, Orchid assesses its necessity in accommodating the needs of diverse user groups. This approach helps streamline the design and maintain simplicity, resulting in a more efficient and user-friendly application.
