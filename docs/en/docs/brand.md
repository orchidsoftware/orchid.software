There are times when you want the visual style of the platform to match your brand.
After installation, two settings are provided that are located in `config/platform.php`:

```php
'template' => [
    'header' => null,
    'footer' => null,
],
```

To change the page header or footer, you must specify your own `blade` templates.

## Change Logo and Name

Create a new directory in the `brand` template section and the`header.blade.php` file.
Then the full path will look like `/resources/views/brand/header.blade.php`.

```php
resources          
└── views
    └── brand
        └── header.blade.php
```

Make changes to the file just created:

```blade
@push('head')
    <link
        href="/favicon.ico"
        id="favicon"
        rel="icon"
    >
@endpush

<div class="h2 d-flex align-items-center">
    @auth
        <x-orchid-icon path="bs.house" class="d-inline d-xl-none"/>
    @endauth

    <p class="my-0 {{ auth()->check() ? 'd-none d-xl-block' : '' }}">
        {{ config('app.name') }}
    </p>
</div>
```

In order for the created template to be used instead of the standard one, you must specify it in the configuration file,
just as if passing an argument in the `view('brand.header')` helper:

```php
'template' => [
    'header' => 'brand.header',
    'footer' => null,
],
```

> **Note.** The configuration file may be cached, and the changes will not take effect until the `php artisan config:clear` command is executed

In the same way, we can change the bottom of the page, again create a new file `/resources/views/brand/footer.blade.php` with the following contents:

```blade
<p class="small m-n">
    © Copyright {{date('Y')}} 
    <a href="{{ config('app.url') }}" target="_blank">
        {{ config('app.name') }}
    </a>
</p>
```

Also making changes to the configuration file:

```php
'template' => [
    'header' => 'brand.header',
    'footer' => 'brand.footer',
],
```

> **Note**. If you want the text or images to be different for the login and panel pages, you can use [Authentication Directives](https://laravel.com/docs/blade#authentication-directives).
